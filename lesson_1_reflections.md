## How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

diff showed me where the files differed, and thus where the typo was.

## How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It would show where and when bugs were introduced, and allow quick edits.

## Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Changes to one file affect another, so git puts files together to track them together. Google Docs is for document files, only usually changed seperately.

## How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log allows you to see all changes, times of changes and messages. git diff is a nice way to diff between two commits.

## How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You know you will be able to see where and when changes were made.
