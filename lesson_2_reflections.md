## What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The folder .git is created, this starts the tracking of changes.

## How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area shows only files that are being committed. Shows what's been changed and is ready to be updated.

## How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

For every change, you can commit the relevant files, and diff between them and the versions in the repo.

## What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Making a specific version of your project (e.g. 'easy mode' of game, or translation of website), to be seperate from, but easily compared to, the original.

## How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They show what commits can be reached from where, and numbers of commits in branches.

## What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

It puts all the changes from one branch into the other, and they are one branch henceforth. The diagrams show the flow of the changes, they literally merge.

## What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Automatic merging is less effort, but could get things wrong. Manual merging is slower, but allows for personal checking of discrepancies.
