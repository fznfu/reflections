## When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You are using more than one machine or are collaborating with others.

## Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may have changes that you want to push to the remote repo that would be overwritten by an automatic update from it.
