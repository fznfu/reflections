## When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You are using more than one machine or are collaborating with others.

## Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may have changes that you want to push to the remote repo that would be overwritten by an automatic update from it.

## Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
To branch a repo is to make a copy of its files, changes to which do not affect the main branch of the repo, unless they are 'merged' back into the main branch; branches are still part of the original repo. To clone a repo is to create your own copy locally or remotely, to make your own edits to it. To fork a repo is to make a copy of someone else's GitHub project to make your own changes to.
